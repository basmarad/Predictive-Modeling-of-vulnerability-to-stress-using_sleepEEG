# Building a predictive model of stress vulnerability using sleepEEG features


# Question/Science Problem

Can we use pre-stress sleep features to predict vulnerability to stress? Can sleep disturbances, prior to stress exposure, be predictors to future stress susceptibility and poor psychiatric outcomes?


Here, we deployed Logistic Regression/SVC/RidgeClassifier models + Feature Engineering to deal with Multicolinearity to answer this question


# ABSTRACT
There is a tight association between mood and sleep as disrupted sleep is a core feature of many mood disorders. 
There is a paucity in available animal models for investigating the role of sleep in the etiopathogenesis of depression. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess whether prior sleep disturbances can predict susceptibility to future stress using the chronic social defeat (CSD) stress paradigm. 
Pre-CSD, mice susceptible to stress displayed increased fragmentation of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, due to increased switching between NREM and wake and a higher percentage of NREM bouts with short duration, relative to resilient mice. The pre-CSD sleep features from both phenotypes were separable enough to allow prediction of susceptibility to stress with around 80% accuracy. Post-CSD, susceptible mice maintained the enhanced NREM fragmentation while resilient mice exhibited high NREM fragmentation, only in the dark. Our findings emphasized the putative role sleep plays in signaling vulnerability to stress.


# Data Struture
After scoring the vigilance states of 7 Susceptible and 7 Resilient mice (Balanced Classification Dataset) pre-exposure to chronic stress, 24 sleep features were extracted prior to exposure to stress:
It is worth mentioning that C57/B6J mice display a fragmented sleep pattern: they sleep in bouts, they spend around 60% of the time during the light cycle in sleep state versus 40% in the dark cycle as they are nocturnal and more active during the dark. Therefore, we extracted sleep EEG features in both Light and Dark phase. In rodents, such as mice and rats, sleep is made of two states: NREM and REM sleep.

# Main Question
Can we use pre-stress sleep features to predict vulnerability to stress? Can sleep disturbances, prior to stress exposure, be predictors to vulnerability and poor psychiatric outcomes?
